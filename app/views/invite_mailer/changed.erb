You've updated your email address used in your RSVP for 
<%= @rsvp.event.name %>.

This means your customized RSVP url has also changed.  The new url is 
http://invite.dague.org<%= url_for :controller => "invite", :action => "show", :id => @rsvp.id,
:key => @rsvp.key %>


Please check back as often as you like to see who else is coming to
the event, and what other people are bringing.  Can't wait to see you
there.
